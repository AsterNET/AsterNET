	Re-homed project to CodePlex with TFS Support
	Upgraded Project to .NET 4.5
	Allow connection to Asterisk 1.8.x - Still uses the 1.6.x logic, so any 1.8 changes are not yet implemented. <- TODO

09.18.2008
	Change read socket to async model (BeginRead/EndRead)
	Add Ping/Pong heartbeat to check connection (ManagerConnection.PingInterval in milliseconds).
	Remove AsteriskManager class (use ManagerConnection).
	Change Events event handler to UnhandleEvent and change event logic:
		 ManagerConnection.FireAllEvents property = false
			ManagerConnection event only individual events by event handlers and event all other (unknown) events to UnhandleEvent
		 ManagerConnection.FireAllEvents property = true
			ManagerConnection event individual events by event handlers and if individual handler not set then fire event to UnhandleEvent
	Combine Connect/Disconnect/Reload/Shutdown events to one ConnectionState event handler.
	Change reconnection login:
		ManagerConnection.KeepAlive property to control auto reconnection on Disconnect/Reload/Shutdown (default true)
		add Reconnect property to Connect/Disconnect/Reload/Shutdown events and if this property = true - it's means that reconnection process started (Disconnect/Reload/Shutdown) or done (Connect)
		by default thi means that two events fire on reconnect. For example:
		1. Reload (.Reconnect = true)
		2. if success Connect (.Reconnect = true)
		3. or fail Disconnect  (.Reconnect = false)
