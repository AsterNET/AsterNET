			ManagerConnection event individual events by event handlers and if individual handler not set then fire event to UnhandleEvent

		add Reconnect property to Connect/Disconnect/Reload/Shutdown events and if this property = true - it's means that reconnection process started (Disconnect/Reload/Shutdown) or done (Connect)

		1. Reload (.Reconnect = true)
