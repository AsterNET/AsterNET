AsterNET is an open source framework for Asterisk AMI and FastAGI. AsterNET allows you to talk to Asterisk AMI from any .NET application and create FastAGI applications in any .NET language.

## Components
AsterNET is made up of two key components, FastAGI and Manager Interface. Each allows you to interact with Asterisk in different ways. FastAGI allows you to control the flow of a call from another machine (a dedicated AGI server for example) and Manager Interface allows you to obtain state information and interact with Asterisk.

## The AGI Gallery
We want the community to share as much as possible, so if you've written an AGI that is either commercial or general purpose, then why not list if on http://www.theagigallery.co.uk. This site has been setup to allow developers to share their creations, open or closed source.

## Blog
You can read about AsterNET and related projects at my blog www.xdev.net. I'll post about AsterNET and related subjects as well as samples I'm working on. Feel free to check it out. Or follow me on twitter (@benjmerrills) to get involved.

## History
AsterNET is a fork of Asterisk.NET. Now we've reached release status and AsterNET version 1.0.0 we feel this is a good separation point from the original project.

There are 2 reasons I have renamed it to AsterNET on codeplex. Asterisk .NET was taken. It will help separate the project from the original codeplex project- in case the guys come back. And keep AsterNET as the new revived project. So it will stop confusing links on search engines, and sharing.
